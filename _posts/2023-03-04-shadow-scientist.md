The Shadow the Scientist (StS) program is run by Professor Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California Santa Cruz. OKH has teamed up with the StS team to bring you live zoom sessions where you can watch scientists perform actual experiments live.  You can watch astronomers use the actual telescopes on Mauna Kea right here!
